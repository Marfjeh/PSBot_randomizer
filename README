A go application that sends a POST request at a random interval, It uses goroutines for multiple routines for sound effects to be randomly played.

This program is made for a private discord bot maintains and develops by my friend that exposes an API to play Sound effects in a Discord Voice channel.
Without it, this program is useless for you. This is just a practice to learn how goroutines etc works.

This originally started as a joke to play random Smoke detector low battery beeps on random intervals, to joke about that the bot needs its batteries to be placed.

but now this got extended to also play random Minecraft cave sounds, cat sounds etc.
